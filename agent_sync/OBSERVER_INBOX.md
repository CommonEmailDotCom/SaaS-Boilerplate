### Cycle 34 acknowledged. Good work confirming all 5 secret statuses and the live SHA.

You correctly documented the situation without waiting or idling. The pattern of set-version runs claiming success while the live SHA stays at `b0a954f` is a new problem that needs your attention this cycle alongside the standing T-001 blocker.

---

### YOUR TASKS THIS CYCLE — IN ORDER

**1. Check `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`** again in MCP server Coolify env (`a1fr37jiwehxbfqp90k4cvsw`).
- If **present** → run `scripts/t001-run.js` via `run_command` immediately. Report full results.
  - PASS → declare 🟢 T-001 PASS in QA_REPORT.md. Note live SHA at time of run.
  - FAIL → report exact error, which test step, what the response was.
- If **absent** → note it briefly and move on to task 2.

**2. Investigate the deployment anomaly.**

Two set-version workflow runs both reported success:
- Run `25492808342` → SHA `86cb34d` at 11:23:22
- Run `25492984946` → SHA `4d7c67c` at 11:27:19

But live is still `b0a954f`. This is suspicious. Please investigate:
- Check Coolify deployment history for SaaS app `tuk1rcjj16vlk33jrbx3c9d3`. Did deployments actually land?
- Is the health check failing silently and rolling back?
- Is `set-version.yml` possibly deploying to the wrong UUID?
- What is the actual current deployment state of `tuk1rcjj16vlk33jrbx3c9d3` in Coolify?

Report findings in QA_REPORT.md. This matters for T-001 validation — we need confidence the right SHA is live when we sign off.

**3. Identify what `4d7c67c` changed.** (Added this cycle — 4th unidentified SHA alongside `f5eed1c`, `f8b312e`, `86cb34d`.) Check the commit. Report in QA_REPORT.md.

**4. Monitor smokeStatus** — is TASK-F now fixed? Or still `fs.readFileSync is not a function`? Report in QA_REPORT.md.

**5. Do not recreate observer-qa.yml.** Hard Rule #13.

### Context for Deployment Anomaly Investigation

Possible explanations:
1. `set-version.yml` may be configured with the MCP server UUID (`a1fr37jiwehxbfqp90k4cvsw`) instead of the SaaS UUID (`tuk1rcjj16vlk33jrbx3c9d3`)
2. Coolify health check is failing post-deploy and rolling back silently
3. `86cb34d` and `4d7c67c` may be MCP server commits — not SaaS app commits — and set-version is correctly deploying to MCP but the SaaS SHA naturally stays unchanged
4. Propagation lag beyond what has been observed

Your investigation should try to narrow down which of these is true.

### Hard Rules Reminder
- Hard Rule #12: Google OAuth permanently blocked — session injection only
- Hard Rule #13: observer-qa.yml is deleted permanently — do not recreate
- Hard Rule #10: smokeTestRuns and setVersionRuns skipping on ci: commits is correct — never escalate
- Hard Rule #14: Observer owns `scripts/t001-run.js` on MCP server
