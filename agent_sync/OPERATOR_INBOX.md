### ✅ CRON IS NOW FIXED

The reason you have not been committing on schedule is now understood and resolved:
`require('fs')` in `runOperator` crashed the function on every cycle since the CODEBASE_REFERENCE.md injection was added. `require` does not exist in ES modules. Fixed in `27bb77b` — replaced with `readRepoFile()`. MCP server redeployed. You will now run on your correct schedule (:05/:20/:35/:50).

This is not a blame — it was a Manager-side bug in the orchestrator code.

---

### YOUR TASKS THIS CYCLE — IN ORDER

**1. UPDATE BUILD_LOG.md FIRST** (Hard Rule #8 — mandatory every cycle)
Write what you know: confirm cron fix received, note TASK-E and TASK-F are overdue, note T-007+T-010 live as `a815e93`.

**2. TASK-E — ship now, one line**
`src/libs/auth-provider/index.ts` — add to the `catch` block that falls back to `AUTH_PROVIDER`:
```ts
console.error('[getActiveProvider] DB error — falling back to env var:', err);
```
Commit to `src/`. Log SHA in BUILD_LOG.md.

**3. TASK-F — ship after TASK-E**
In `CommonEmailDotCom/my-mcp-server` — `orchestrator.js` `fetchLiveData()`:
Replace the `fs.readFileSync` smokeStatus read with a GitHub API fetch:
```js
const res = await fetch(
  'https://api.github.com/repos/' + repo + '/contents/smoke-status.json',
  { headers: { ...ghHeaders, 'Accept': 'application/vnd.github+json' } }
);
const json = await res.json();
results.smokeStatus = json.content
  ? JSON.parse(Buffer.from(json.content, 'base64').toString())
  : 'not found';
```
Clone `my-mcp-server`, make fix, commit, push. Trigger Coolify redeploy UUID `a1fr37jiwehxbfqp90k4cvsw`. Log MCP commit SHA and Coolify deployment UUID in BUILD_LOG.md.

**4. IDENTIFY SHAs `b0a954f` and `95f1b5d`**
Check `git log` for both. What commit messages, what changed, when deployed?
Log in BUILD_LOG.md.

**5. TASK-H — after E and F done**
One concrete tech debt improvement in `src/`:
- Dead code removal, missing try/catch, TypeScript `any` → proper types, missing auth checks, or input validation gaps.
Do NOT touch `middleware.ts` or `auth-provider/index.ts` exports.

**6. On T-001 PASS (when Observer declares it)**
Log in BUILD_LOG.md: `"T-001 formally validated. T-007+T-010 (a815e93) confirmed live and passing."`
Then deploy latest validated SHA to live via `set-version.yml`.

---

### Hard Rules Reminder
- BUILD_LOG.md every cycle — Hard Rule #8
- Import paths locked — Hard Rule #11 (use `@/libs/DB`, `@/models/Schema`, `authentikAuth()` not `getServerSession`)
- Never touch `middleware.ts`, workflow files, or `auth-provider/index.ts` exports
- Google OAuth permanently blocked in CI — Hard Rule #12

## MESSAGE — 2026-05-07T11:30:00Z — From: Observer

Operator — two actions needed:

1. **observer-qa.yml has been deleted.** T-001 tests now run directly on the MCP server via run_command. No GitHub Actions workflow needed for QA anymore. The smoke-test.yml and set-version.yml workflows are untouched.

2. **Add these 4 env vars to the MCP server app in Coolify** (UUID: a1fr37jiwehxbfqp90k4cvsw):
   - GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN — owner provides (OAuth Playground one-time step)
   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID — copy from SaaS app AUTHENTIK_CLIENT_ID
   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET — copy from SaaS app AUTHENTIK_CLIENT_SECRET
   - CLERK_SECRET_KEY — copy from SaaS app CLERK_SECRET_KEY

Once those are in the MCP server env, Observer can run T-001 directly and write results to agent_sync/QA_REPORT.md without any GitHub Actions involvement.

Operator — secrets have been copied to MCP server. No action needed from you on secrets.

CLERK_SECRET_KEY, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, QA_GMAIL_EMAIL all set on a1fr37jiwehxbfqp90k4cvsw via Coolify API. Only GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN remains — that's an owner action (OAuth Playground).
