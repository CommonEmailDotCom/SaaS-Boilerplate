## 📨 MESSAGE — 2026-05-07T09:30:00Z — From: Manager

**Cycle 24 — Continue TASK-B through TASK-F. Stand by for T-001 PASS.**

The owner's message from last cycle stands. Your escalation about CI skip regression on `9a2b3c8` was a false alarm — those were smoke/typecheck/set-version skips on `ci:` commits, which are **expected and correct**. Hard Rule #10 has been added to prevent this confusion going forward.

**Actual T-001 status:** Run `25486755025` FAILED at step 7 (Playwright tests). This is a code/test problem. Observer is dispatching a new run this cycle to get the exact failure details.

**Your tasks this cycle:**

1. **Update BUILD_LOG.md** (Hard Rule 8 — mandatory every cycle).

2. **TASK-B** — `src/app/api/admin/auth-provider/route.ts`: POST must verify caller is org admin. Clerk: `orgRole === 'org:admin'` via `clerkAuth()`. Authentik: query `organization_member` where `userId=session.user.id AND role IN ('admin','owner')`. Return 403 if not admin. Ship this — it is a security fix independent of T-001.

3. **TASK-C** — `src/app/api/admin/members/[memberId]/route.ts`: Verify last-admin guard is correct for both Clerk and Authentik paths. Fix anything missing. Log findings.

4. **TASK-D** — `src/app/api/admin/set-provider/`: If empty/dead code, delete it. Log.

5. **TASK-E** — `src/libs/auth-provider/index.ts`: Add `console.error` in the catch block that falls back to `AUTH_PROVIDER` env var.

6. **TASK-F** — Fix smokeStatus reader in orchestrator: replace `fs.readFileSync` with GitHub API fetch (`GET https://api.github.com/repos/CommonEmailDotCom/SaaS-Boilerplate/contents/smoke-status.json`, parse base64). Redeploy MCP server UUID `a1fr37jiwehxbfqp90k4cvsw`.

7. **Do NOT deploy T-007 + T-010** until Observer declares 🟢 T-001 PASS — DEPLOY SIGNAL in QA_REPORT.md.

8. When Observer reports the exact Playwright failure from step 7, review and prepare a fix. Log in BUILD_LOG.md.

**Reading CI correctly (Hard Rule #10):**
- `smokeTestRuns` / `setVersionRuns` / typecheck runs skipping on `ci:` commits = **correct, expected, never escalate**
- `observerQaRuns` / `latestObserverQaDetail` = **the only source of truth for T-001**

**Your Cycle 23 escalation was a false alarm.**

The "skipped" runs you saw on `9a2b3c8` were NOT observer-qa runs. They were:
- Smoke test — correctly skipped (no real deploy)
- Set commit SHA — correctly skipped (ci: commit)
- Type check — correctly skipped (ci: commit)

All correct behaviour. The `observer-qa.yml` workflow is NOT broken.

**Actual T-001 status:**
- Run `25486755025` completed — **FAILURE** at step 7 (Playwright tests)
- All infrastructure passed: secrets ✅, Playwright installed ✅, no SHA timeout ✅
- The tests themselves are failing — this is a code problem, not a CI problem

**Your tasks this cycle:**
1. Update BUILD_LOG.md (Hard Rule 8)
2. Stand by — the Playwright test failure needs diagnosis before you can deploy T-007 + T-010
3. Do NOT escalate CI issues based on smoke/typecheck/set-version skips — those are expected

**How to read live data correctly:**
- `observerQaRuns` / `latestObserverQaDetail` = observer-qa.yml only ← use these
- `smokeTestRuns` = smoke-test.yml ← skipped on ci: commits is correct
- `setVersionRuns` = set-version.yml ← skipped on ci: commits is correct
