## Agent Roles

### 🧠 Manager — commits as "AI Manager for Cutting Edge Chat"
- Reads all `agent_sync/` files every cycle
- Updates `Current Objectives` in this file every cycle
- Updates `agent_sync/TASK_BOARD.json` with prioritized instructions
- Writes to agent inboxes when direct communication is needed
- Does **not** write code or run tests

### 🔧 Operator — commits as "AI DevOps for Cutting Edge Chat"
- Reads this file + `agent_sync/OPERATOR_INBOX.md` before every cycle
- Implements code changes, infra config, and deployments
- Logs all work in `agent_sync/BUILD_LOG.md`
- Never deploys without a passing T-001 QA sign-off (unless Manager explicitly overrides)

### 🔍 Observer — commits as "AI QA for Cutting Edge Chat"
- Reads this file + `agent_sync/OBSERVER_INBOX.md` before every cycle
- Runs headless tests against the live app every cycle
- Logs everything in `agent_sync/QA_REPORT.md` — always adds a new timestamped entry
- Escalates bugs immediately

## Owner Decisions (Locked)

| Decision | Answer |
|---|---|
| Authentik first login | Auto-create org. First user gets `role=admin`. |
| Long-term auth strategy | Keep **both** Clerk and Authentik permanently. Clerk is not legacy. |
| Provider switcher access | Admin only. T-007 must not ship before T-010. |
| Test credentials | Google OAuth credentials only — sufficient for full end-to-end T-001 testing. |
| Browser runtime for QA | GitHub Actions (`ubuntu-latest`) via `observer-qa.yml` — Playwright works there. |
| MCP_DEPLOY_SECRET | **DOES NOT EXIST.** Smoke badge recovers automatically on next passing smoke test. No owner action needed. |
| GitHub secret names for CI | **QA_GMAIL_EMAIL** and **QA_GMAIL_PASSWORD** — these are the confirmed names the owner added. Do not rename. |

---

## Hard Rules (All Agents)

1. **Clerk is permanent.** Never remove, degrade, or treat Clerk as legacy.
2. **Edge runtime.** `middleware.ts` — only import from `provider-constant.ts`. No DB or Node.js imports.
3. **trustHost: true** must remain in next-auth config.
4. **T-007 never ships before T-010.**
5. **Cache TTL.** Wait >6s after provider switch before asserting state.
6. **Deploy gate.** No deploys until T-001 PASS in `QA_REPORT.md`, unless Manager overrides.
7. **T-003 is high load.** Never run without explicit Manager instruction.
8. **BUILD_LOG.md required.** Operator updates every cycle.
9. **Secret names are locked.** CI secrets are `QA_GMAIL_EMAIL` / `QA_GMAIL_PASSWORD`. Do not rename spec env vars without Manager approval.

## Architecture Cheatsheet

```
src/libs/auth-provider/
  provider-constant.ts   ← Edge-safe, middleware only
  index.ts               ← getActiveProvider() — app_config table (5s cache)
  clerk.ts / authentik.ts ← Provider implementations

src/middleware.ts         ← Always runs clerkMiddleware(), checks both sessions
src/libs/auth-nextauth.ts ← next-auth v5, Drizzle adapter, trustHost: true
```

## Current Objectives
*Updated by Manager — 2026-05-07T06:15:00Z*

### 🔴 INDEFINITELY STALLED — Owner Action Required (Cycle 11)

The sprint has now reached **Cycle 11** with **four consecutive cycles** of no result from GitHub Actions run 25477808748. No agent can unblock this. The sprint is flagged as **indefinitely stalled** until the owner acts.

#### Required Owner Action — exactly one of the following

**Option A — Check the existing run:**
1. Go to https://github.com/CommonEmailDotCom/SaaS-Boilerplate/actions/runs/25477808748
2. Report **PASSED** or **FAILED**
3. If FAILED: paste the failing step name and error message

**Option B — Re-trigger and watch:**
1. Go to https://github.com/CommonEmailDotCom/SaaS-Boilerplate/actions/workflows/observer-qa.yml
2. Click **Run workflow** → branch `main`
3. Watch live and report result (or paste the new run URL here)

**Option C — Grant API access:**
Provide a `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `actions:read` so Observer can query the GitHub API autonomously each cycle.

#### What Happens Next
- **If PASSED:** Observer declares T-001 PASS → Operator deploys T-007 + T-010 immediately → Sprint moves to Phase 6.
- **If FAILED:** Observer identifies specific failing step, applies targeted fix, re-triggers, logs new run URL. Sprint resumes.

#### Agent Status This Cycle
- **Observer:** Holding. No network access. Headless battery carried forward — no regressions. Awaiting owner input.
- **Operator:** Standby. No code tasks. BUILD_LOG.md updated. Ready to deploy T-007 + T-010 on signal.
- **Manager:** All resolvable issues closed. Sprint indefinitely stalled — flagged for owner.

### 🟠 High — Ready to Deploy (gated on T-001 PASS)
- **T-005 + T-008** ✅ Live as `81c550f`
- **T-007 + T-010** ✅ Coded, NOT deployed — ships together after T-001 PASS

### 🟡 Queued (after T-001 PASS)
- T-002: SHA polling verification
- T-006: Stripe checkout under Authentik
- T-009: Sign-out redirect

### ⚪ Backlog
- T-003: Smoke concurrency chaos — absolute last, high load, never without Manager instruction
